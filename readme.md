      - Working on a slide deck for a workshop I'm leading for [ChickTech](https://chicktech.org/).
        + Customizing [reveal.js](https://revealjs.com/) —  the awesome open-source presentation software by [Hakim El](https://hakim.se/).
        + Testing out some features at [Ludus](https://ludus.one/) — an impressive design-driven online presentation SaaS app. 
        + Iterating on my lesson plan. Following Google's [Applied Digital Skills Lesson Plan](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1E3KZf4OwRZadim0ORDPJ3QSAsPs-ZB8CA4XBdtprbck/edit) format. Determining the best way to teach Markdown to highschool students.
      - Writing a tutorial on workflows for creating clean explainer GIFs from screen-capture sources.
      - Studing for a Google Cloud Platform Certification. 
        + I made an [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/) flashcard deck ([spaced repetition learning](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Spaced_repetition)) for studying. You can [download it here](https://gist.github.com/rowe-morehouse/d6edb1f0367c18c736dde70d29bbc218).
      - Contributing to [Lazycard](https://github.com/hikikones/Lazycard) — a cool little React / Electron app for flashcards.
      - Working on the ImageScrounge MVP. ImageScrounge is a little desktop app I'm making. Its main feature enables simultaneously previwing multiple images at their natural dimensions — as opposed to images being rendered into thumbnails, constrained by a preview app window.
      - Iterating on Swayze: my Facebook Messenger AI chatbot built with [Wit AI](https://wit.ai/). I've been neglecting him. Swayze needs some love. :)
