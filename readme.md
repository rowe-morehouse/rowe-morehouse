        ‚Ä¶ I had <strong>two titanium discs implanted in my neck</strong> and my right hand freakin' kills and is numb due to neuropathic radiculopathy. I can type, but I can barely write with a ballpoint pen.  
      <h3>SO ‚Ä¶</h3>

<strong>I am trying something new</strong> that will allow me to compute while exercising my motor skills:<br /><br />

</div>

‚Ä¶ we'll see how it goes.

<h3>Here's what's cooking this month:</h3>

<li>I'm kinda hooked on <a href="https://bitclout.com/">BitClout</a>! ‚Ä¶ People are buying my Creator Coin (@rowemorehouse) in exchange for the <a href="https://www.mixcloud.com/Gods_of_the_New_Age/music-for-programming-vol-6/">original ambient music</a> I create & make available to the community. It might be just fad, but it's&nbsp;fun ‚Ä¶
<small><br /><br /></small><li>I'm studying for a <a href="https://www.qualtrics.com/">Qualtrics</a> certification and a cert called "IBM Enterprise Design Thinking." Both are super interesting. 
<small><br /><br /></small><li>Check out my <strong><a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1F-uq6lqjr7ZSqphSb8LyPb7UPPisIT0SrOYc8IuE5Ac/edit?usp=sharing">Big List of Dark Patterns</a></strong> (google sheet) ‚Äî with copywriting examples! ‚Äî and offending URLs that demonstate the patterns! ‚Ä¶ Or if you're in a hurry, here's <a href="https://www.darkpatterns.org/types-of-dark-pattern">the TL;DR on Dark Patterns</a>. GO AHEAD & MAKE A COPY FOR YOURSELF, TOUGH GUY. üòú
<small><br /><br /></small><li>I made a list of over 12,000 keywords that elicit <em>positive emotions</em> vs <em>negative emotions</em> ‚Ä¶ you can check it out ‚á® <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1DjsQzSqYtgoyqW9UmptcrnmqLx73mbch7M0zmV5VuuQ/edit?usp=sharing">on this google sheet</a>. I'm using it for copywriting. MAKE A COPY FOR YOURSELF. ‚ú® 
<small><br /><br /></small><li>I'm experimenting with <a href="https://saifmohammad.com/WebPages/NRC-Emotion-Lexicon.htm">The NRC Word-Emotion Association Lexicon (EmoLex)</a> and other corpi ‚Äî like <a href="https://www.kovcomp.co.uk/wordstat/LIWC.html">The LICW 2015</a> and OpenLexicon, for example ‚Äî to do <a href="https://monkeylearn.com/blog/opinion-mining/">opinion mining</a> on a dataset of <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/rowemorehouse/googleplaystoreuserreviews">Google Playstore App Reviews</a> I made on Kaggle.
<small><br /><br /></small>
<ul type="circle">
<li><strong>My goal with this whole Machine Learning / Artificial Intelligence</strong> angle-of-inquiry is to learn to„Äê1„Äëwrite more engaging copy,„Äê2„Äë<ins>develop more empathetic products</ins>, and„Äê3„Äëdesign better UI components. The research that's out there gives me an <a href="https://web.stanford.edu/~jurafsky/slp3/slides/21_SentLex.pdf">evidence-based direction</a> ‚Ä¶ plus it's fun to spin-up the AI stuff on Google Cloud.
<small><br /><br /></small>
<li>"<a href="https://swayze.ai/">Swayze</a>" ‚Äî <strong>my Facebook Messenger chatbot</strong> <a href="https://wit.ai">built with Wit AI</a> ‚Äî is still asleep. BUT WAIT!! ‚Ä¶ with great fortune, Facebook (The best app of all time, fight me) has finally biz verified my corp. I'm looking forward to developing more apps on their platform.
<small><br /><br /></small>
<li><strong>Participating in Facebook's Wit.ai Hackathon</strong> is what sent me down this AI path. I've also been working with <a href="https://cloud.google.com/dialogflow/docs">Dialog Flow</a>, and I've got the basic codebase set up for porting Swayze into an <a href="https://developer.amazon.com/en-US/docs/alexa/custom-skills/host-a-custom-skill-as-an-aws-lambda-function.html">Amazon Alexa Skill</a>.
</ul>
<br /><li>Oh yah, <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/speech-synthesis/">SSML</a>. I'm audio recording the dialogue (speech) from free webinars / tutorials / interviews and then feeding it to <a href="https://cloud.google.com/speech-to-text">GCP speech-to-text</a>.<br />
<br />Then <strong>I make it speak back</strong> to you in a Google Voice ‚Äî with my instinctual SSML voice inflection markup and my <strong>fun sound effects</strong> courtesy of <a href="https://developer.amazon.com/en-US/docs/alexa/custom-skills/ask-soundlibrary.html">Amazon Alexa Skills Kit Sound Library</a>. In my mind, this is a new way of repurposing content.<br /><br /> This is part of my <strong>ongoing obsession with audio recording</strong> and <strong>speech editing</strong>.<br />  
<br /><li>I want to try to do this type of content repurposing at scale with services like <a href="https://contentyze.com">Contentyze</a> and <a href="https://anyword.com/">Anyword</a>. üëÄ<br />
<br /><li>ALSO I'M DOING stuff with <a href="https://tailwindcss.com/">Tailwind CSS</a> ‚Äî just like everyone else is. If you want to know the original people behind Utility-Based CSS it was <a href="https://twitter.com/mrmrs_">@mrmrs_</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/jxnblk">@jxnblk</a> ‚Ä¶ or at least those are the dudes I've been following / copying from for years related to cutting-edge CSS stuff.<br />
<br /><li><strong>DESIGN THOUGHTS</strong>: the <a href="https://reinvent.awsevents.com/">AWS re:Invent 2020 design language</a> is full of hot-pink on black, candy gradient buttons, and warping animated <a href="https://www.google.com/search?source=univ&tbm=isch&q=1970s+graphic+design+geometric+artist&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjFr4qDxO_sAhVLop4KHZHcAZIQ7Al6BAgFEFA&biw=1440&bih=799">1970s geometric midcentury motifs</a>. Fresh.
<small><br /><br /></small><li>‚ú®‚ú® My November 2020 <a href="https://chicktech.org">ChickTech Workshop</a></strong> TEACHING WEB PROGRAMMING skills to HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS went really well.   
<small><br /><br /></small><ul type="circle">
<li><strong>Teaching at ChickTech</strong> is <ins>my main volunteer activity</ins>, for three (3) years now. 
<li>Google's <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1E3KZf4OwRZadim0ORDPJ3QSAsPs-ZB8CA4XBdtprbck/edit">Applied Digital Skills Lesson Plan</a> format was a great inspiration for me.
<li>Customizing <a href="https://ludus.one">Ludus</a>, <a href="https://shwr.me/">Shower</a>, and <a href="https://revealjs.com">reveal.js</a> was a great experience for me, and I think the students got a lot out of my presentation. 
</ul>
<br /><li>I am working on becoming <strong>a Google Developer Expert</strong> ‚Äî to grow my <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23DevRel">#DevRel</a> skills. For GCP stuff I made an <a href="https://apps.ankiweb.net">Anki</a> flashcard deck (<a href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Spaced_repetition">spaced repetition learning</a>) for you. If you care, you can <a href="https://gist.github.com/rowe-morehouse/d6edb1f0367c18c736dde70d29bbc218">download it here</a>.
<small><br /><br /></small><li>I'm contributing programming to <a href="https://github.com/hikikones/Lazycard">Lazycard</a> ‚Äî a cool little <strong>React / Electron app</strong> for making flashcards.
<small><br /><br /></small><li>I've completed my <strong>ImageScrounge</strong> MVP. ImageScrounge is a little desktop app I'm making. It currently works perfectly to scratch my own itch. I'm writing up <strong>the PR&nbsp;FAQ</strong> and I'm gonna have some buddies help me improve it.
<small><br /><br /></small><li>That's what's up!
