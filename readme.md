      <h3>&nbsp;üå±&nbsp; Here's what I'm up to lately:</h3>
  Slice, cuttin' choppin' ‚Ä¶<br/><br/>
          <img src="https://github.com/rowe-morehouse/rowe-morehouse/raw/master/implants-orig.png" width=180px align=left><br /><br/>
        ‚Ä¶ I had <strong>two titanium discs implanted in my neck</strong> ‚Äî WTF! ‚Ä¶ too much Metallica.
 <BR CLEAR=all>

<h3>ANYWAY, here's what's cooking this month:</h3>

<ul>
<li>Continued focus on Sales & Selling! ‚Äî writing about Sales Techniques, Sales Process, Sales Coaching, Sales Enablement, and SaaS Sales Tools inlcuding <a href="https://www.g2.com/best-software-companies/top-sales" target=_blank>G2's Best Sales Products of 2023<a>. Current side hustle (among several) ü°í <strong>Sourcing Advisor for #SalesTech</strong> purchase decisions for a for a $10M Bay Area SaaS company.  <small><br /><br /></small>
<li>Massively up-skilled up in email marketing ‚Äî <strong>value messaging, sequencing, and the technical side</strong> of delivery. Did you know I've been doing email marketing since 2002? Also, I used to sell email advertising. Sold probably $500,000 worth of email. Now I use email <em>mostly for prospecting & lead gen for my offers</em>, and of course I run campaings to support my sales efforts for the companies I sell for. Additionally, I set up cold email infrastructure and write cold email sequences for my clients, as a consultant.<small><br /><br /></small>
<li>Working on the <a href="https://www.salesforce.com/blog/salesblazer/">Salesforce Salesblazer</a> certification. Should be pretty easy, $200 bucks to take the test though. You can <a href="https://trailblazer.me/id/rowe-morehouse">see my other Salesforce certifications here</a>.
<small><br /><br /></small>
<li>For these certificatons I enjoy studying for, I'm preferring <strong><a href="https://zorbi.com" target=_blank>"Zorbi"<a></strong> for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition">spaced repetition learning</a>. You can create flashcards from Notion, which is pretty cool.<small><br /><br /></small>
<li>I'm <strike>maintaining</strike> no longer maintaining a <a href="https://gist.github.com/rowe-morehouse/b73cd74f5ed0e60633eb233244bd69e6" target="new">List of AI Writing Tools</a> I started compiling 2 years ago. Too much AI HYPE out there for me to deal with. I do, however, regularly use GPT and Bard for industry research, brainstorming, paraphrasing, summarizing, & context-based sales email customization. ü§ñ<small><br /><br /></small>
<li>üîß ‚Å£<strong>I wrote a piece</strong> on <a href="https://rowemore.medium.com/taming-uncertainty-and-risk-in-product-management-5cac9eb85dec">Managing Risk in Product Management</a>. ‚óÅ Check it out on Medium.
<small><br /><br /></small>
<li>Marketers, check out my <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1F-uq6lqjr7ZSqphSb8LyPb7UPPisIT0SrOYc8IuE5Ac/edit?usp=sharing">Big List of Dark Patterns</a> (google sheet) ‚Äî with copywriting examples! ‚Äî and offending URLs that demonstate the patterns! ‚Ä¶ Or if you're in a hurry, here's <a href="https://www.darkpatterns.org/types-of-dark-pattern">the TL;DR on Dark Patterns</a>.
<small><br /><br /></small><li>I made a list of over 12,000 keywords that elicit <em>positive emotions</em> vs <em>negative emotions</em> ‚Ä¶ you can check it out ‚á® <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1DjsQzSqYtgoyqW9UmptcrnmqLx73mbch7M0zmV5VuuQ/edit?usp=sharing">on this google sheet</a>. I'm using it for copywriting. MAKE A COPY FOR YOURSELF. ‚ú®
<small><br /><br /></small><li>I'm experimenting with <a href="https://saifmohammad.com/WebPages/NRC-Emotion-Lexicon.htm">The NRC Word-Emotion Association Lexicon (EmoLex)</a> and other corpi ‚Äî like <a href="https://www.kovcomp.co.uk/wordstat/LIWC.html">The LICW 2015</a> and OpenLexicon, for example ‚Äî to do <a href="https://monkeylearn.com/blog/opinion-mining/">opinion mining</a> on a dataset of <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/rowemorehouse/googleplaystoreuserreviews">Google Playstore App Reviews</a> I made on Kaggle.
<small><br /><br /></small>
<ul type="circle">
<li><strong>My goal with this whole Machine Learning / Artificial Intelligence</strong> angle-of-inquiry is to learn to„Äê1„Äëwrite more engaging copy,„Äê2„Äëdevelop more empathetic products, and„Äê3„Äëdesign better UI components. The research that's out there gives me an <a href="https://web.stanford.edu/~jurafsky/slp3/slides/21_SentLex.pdf">evidence-based direction</a> ‚Ä¶ plus it's <strike>fun to spin-up the AI stuff on Google Cloud</strike> not that fun anymore when GPT is so easy to use & a gazillion products out there w/ their own angle on it.
<small><br /><br /></small>
<li>"Swayze" ‚Äî <strong>my Facebook Messenger AI chatbot</strong> built with <a href="https://wit.ai">Wit AI</a> ‚Äî is now retired. It never really worked very well. I found building with Wit AI to be difficult. But it did send me down the path toward Google's <a href="https://cloud.google.com/dialogflow/docs">Dialog Flow</a> and doing speech-to-text and text-to-speech ‚Äî which is related to my ongoing obession with audio editing.
<small><br /><br /></small>
<li>You can check out this (DJ?) mix I made, I did it in Audacity. <a href="https://www.mixcloud.com/Rowe-Morehouse/music-for-programming-vol-6/"> A relaxing hour long feel-good abstract ambient mix</a>. ‚Äî I think it's killer, have a listen.
</ul>
<li>I led a <a href="https://chicktech.org">ChickTech Workshop</a> TEACHING WEB PROGRAMMING skills to high school students from disadvantaged communities. It went really well. I got good feedback from the students, and from the Executive Director.
<small><br /><br /></small><ul type="circle">
<li><strong>Teaching at ChickTech</strong> is <ins>my main volunteer activity</ins>, for three (3) years now.
<li>Google's <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1E3KZf4OwRZadim0ORDPJ3QSAsPs-ZB8CA4XBdtprbck/edit">Applied Digital Skills Lesson Plan</a> format was a great inspiration.
<li>Designing with <a href="https://ludus.one">Ludus</a>, <a href="https://shwr.me/">Shower</a>, and <a href="https://revealjs.com">reveal.js</a> was fun.
</ul>
<small><br /><br /></small><li>I've completed my <strong>ImageScrounge</strong> MVP. ImageScrounge is a little desktop app I'em making. It currently works perfectly to scratch my own itch. I'm writing up <strong>the PR&nbsp;FAQ</strong> and I'm gonna have some buddies help me improve it.
<small><br /><br /></small><li>
Check out a comprehensive list of <strong>all of my <a href="https://rowe-morehouse.github.io/resume/uses/" alt="Rowe Morehouse ¬∑ Software Tools">Software Tools</a></strong><i> ‚Äî (dev tools, productivity, collaboration, audio, design, etc.)</i><small><br /><br /></small></li>
        
<li>That's what's up!</li>
