        <small><em>DECEMBER, 2020</em></small>
      <h3>&nbsp;Here's what I'm up to lately:</h3>
      <ul>
      <li>Oh noes! ‚Ä¶ <br /><br />"<a href="https://swayze.ai/">Swayze</a>" ‚Äî my Facebook Messenger chatbot <a href="https://wit.ai">built with Wit AI</a> ‚Äî is still asleep. BUT WAIT!! ‚Ä¶ with great fortune, Facebook (The best app of all time, fight me) has finally biz verified my corp. I'm looking forward to developing more apps on their platform and running more ads.
      <small><br /><br /></small><li>I made a list of over 12,000 keywords that elicit <em>positive emotions</em> vs <em>negative emotions</em> ‚Ä¶ you can check it out <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1DjsQzSqYtgoyqW9UmptcrnmqLx73mbch7M0zmV5VuuQ/edit?usp=sharing">on this google sheet</a>. I'm using it for copywriting. MAKE A COPY FOR YOURSELF. üòÉ
      <small><br /><br /></small><li>I'm experimenting with <a href="https://saifmohammad.com/WebPages/NRC-Emotion-Lexicon.htm">The NRC Word-Emotion Association Lexicon (EmoLex)</a> and other corpi ‚Äî like <a href="https://www.kovcomp.co.uk/wordstat/LIWC.html">The LICW 2015</a> and OpenLexicon, for example ‚Äî to do <a href="https://monkeylearn.com/blog/opinion-mining/">opinion mining</a> on a dataset of <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/rowemorehouse/googleplaystoreuserreviews">Google Playstore App Reviews</a> I made on Kaggle.
      <small><br /><br /></small>
      <ul type="circle">
      <li><strong>My goal with this whole Machine Learning / Artifical Intelligence</strong> angle-of-inquiry is to learn to 1) write more engaging copy, 2) develop more empathetic products, and 3) design better UI components. The research that's out there gives me an <a href="https://web.stanford.edu/~jurafsky/slp3/slides/21_SentLex.pdf">evidence-based direction</a> ‚Ä¶ plus it's fun to spin-up the AI stuff on Google Cloud.
      <small><br /><br /></small><li>Participating in Facebook's Wit.ai hackathon is what sent me down this AI path. I've also been working with <a href="https://cloud.google.com/dialogflow/docs">Dialog Flow</a>, and I've got the basic codebase set up for porting Swayze into an <a href="https://developer.amazon.com/en-US/docs/alexa/custom-skills/host-a-custom-skill-as-an-aws-lambda-function.html">Amazon Alexa Skill</a>.
      </ul>
      <br /><li>Oh yah, <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/speech-synthesis/">SSML</a>. I'm audio recording the speech from free webinars / tutorials / interviews and then feeding it to <a href="https://cloud.google.com/speech-to-text">GCP speech-to-text</a>.<br />
      <br />Then <strong>I make it speak back</strong> in the Google Voice I want it to ‚Äî with my instinctual SSML voice inflections and my <strong>fun sound effects</strong> courtesy of <a href="https://developer.amazon.com/en-US/docs/alexa/custom-skills/ask-soundlibrary.html">Amazon Alexa Skills Kit Sound Library</a>. In my mind, this is a new way of repurposing content ‚Äî and it will be faster for people like you to learn from.<br /><br /> This is part of my <u>ongoing obsession</u> with audio recording and <u>speech editing</u>.<br />  
      <br /><li>I want to try to do this type of content repurposing at scale with services like <a href="https://contentyze.com">Contentyze</a> and <a href="https://petacrunch.com/">PetaCrunch</a>.<br />
      <br /><li>ALSO I'M DOING stuff with <a href="https://tailwindcss.com/">Tailwind CSS</a> ‚Äî just like everyone else is. If you want to know the original people behind Utility-Based CSS it was <a href="https://twitter.com/mrmrs_">@mrmrs_</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/jxnblk">@jxnblk</a> ‚Ä¶ or at least those are the dudes I've been following / copying from for years related to cutting-edge CSS stuff.<br />
      <br /><li>DESIGN THOUGHTS: the <a href="https://reinvent.awsevents.com/">AWS re:Invent 2020 design language</a> is full of hot-pink on black, candy gradient buttons, and warping animated <a href="https://www.google.com/search?source=univ&tbm=isch&q=1970s+graphic+design+geometric+artist&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjFr4qDxO_sAhVLop4KHZHcAZIQ7Al6BAgFEFA&biw=1440&bih=799">1970s geometric midcentury motifs</a>. Fresh.<br />
      <br /><li>I'm getting better at <strong>screen recording</strong> for creating software explainer videos.
      <small><br /><br /></small><li>I've written a tutorial on a good workflow for creating explainer GIFs from screen-capture sources, but I'm not sure where to publish it right now! ‚Ä¶ Medium? ‚Ä¶ PS: for MacOS: I'm liking <a href="https://xnipapp.com/">xnip</a> and <a href="https://getkap.co/">kap</a>. Almost forgot <a href="https://gist.github.com/rowe-morehouse/33e8fa9575a42268f44dc16f2980f3c6">FFMpeg</a>,  I'm loving it.
      <small><br /><br /></small><li>‚ú®‚ú® My November 2020 <a href="https://chicktech.org">ChickTech Workshop</a></strong> TEACHING WEB PROGRAMMING skills to HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS went really well.   
      <small><br /><br /></small><ul type="circle">
      <li>Teaching at ChickTech is my main volunteer activity, for three (3) years now. 
      <li>Google's <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1E3KZf4OwRZadim0ORDPJ3QSAsPs-ZB8CA4XBdtprbck/edit">Applied Digital Skills Lesson Plan</a> format was a great inspiration for me.
      <li>Customizing <a href="https://revealjs.com">reveal.js</a> ‚Äî an awesome open-source presentation app</a> ‚Äî and using <a href="https://ludus.one">Ludus</a> ‚Äî another impressive design-driven presentation app ‚Äî was a great experience; and I think the students got a lot out of it.
      </ul>
      <br /><li><strike>I've been studying for the Google Cloud Developer certification</strike>¬†‚Ä¶ Instead of doing this I am working on becoming <strong>a Google Developer Expert</strong> ‚Äî to grow my <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23DevRel">#DevRel</a> skills. For GCP stuff I made an <a href="https://apps.ankiweb.net">Anki</a> flashcard deck (<a href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Spaced_repetition">spaced repetition learning</a>) for you. If you care, you can <a href="https://gist.github.com/rowe-morehouse/d6edb1f0367c18c736dde70d29bbc218">download here</a>.
      <small><br /><br /></small><li>I'm contributing programming to <a href="https://github.com/hikikones/Lazycard">Lazycard</a> ‚Äî a cool little React / Electron app for flashcards.
      <small><br /><br /></small><li>ALSO I AM WORKING ON my <strong>ImageScrounge</strong> MVP. ImageScrounge is a little desktop app I'm making. It currently works perfectly to scratch my own itch. I'm writing up the PR&nbsp;FAQ.
      <small><br /><br /></small><li>That's what's up! Also a reminder to you, dear reader. Haters gonna hate. Do your damn thing. :)
